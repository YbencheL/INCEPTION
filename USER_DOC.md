This file is a user documentation made to make it easier for a user to understand whats provided here by this stack.

First of all, we gonna start by explaining what are the services provided here, the main 3 here are mariadb nginx and wordpress, your gonna find all of them inside the requirements folder that is inside the srcs folder, so as you probably noticed by now these 3 service are made to run a wordpress website with our own mariadb databases on our configured nginx webserv so by the end of it you gonna be able to configure all this 3 parts and access a admin user page in wordpress to have more control of it all, plus in the bonus side we have another 4 additional servers ftp for file transfer (i use filezilla to transfer files from the container to our host machine)
